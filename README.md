a very simple and nice looking time table one page website or app,
say whatever you want 
it shows the current lecture in big green words and upcoming lectures in yellow and many more functionalities

//green means ongoing things
//yellow signifies upcoming
//red tells us to not to worry about ðŸ˜„

you can bookmark the site for quick checking of the session
i am also working on adding some new funcitonalities such as adding your own schedule/timetable so that you can use it too. 

//currently it has only my time table but no worries it won't take long
